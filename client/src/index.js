//Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. 
//It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, 
//with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

//React-Redux is our official package that lets your React components interact with a Redux store 
//by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the storeã€‚
