# mern-connected

Following the youtube tutorial of building and deploying a Full Stack MERN Project.

Please view the codes in the master branch.

Version 1.0: https://forumapi.netlify.app/
Version 2.0: https://connected.netlify.app/

# Progress
Implemented the Google OAuth Authentication.
Continue working on the Login with Email Authentication.
Google OAuth Authentication is now not available on https://connected.netlify.app/, as Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs are set to the local host so that I can continue working on the JWT authentication.
